## ðŸš€ Why This Project Exists

The inspiration for this dashboard came from a desire to better understand how my professional network has evolved over time â€” not just who Iâ€™m connected to, but where they work, what roles they hold, and how those patterns shift across the years. Rather than staring at rows in a CSV, I wanted something that visually told the story of my LinkedIn journey â€” patterns in hiring, clusters of industries, and surges in new connections.

This project turns passive data into active insight.

## ðŸ“Š From Data to Dashboard

At its core, this dashboard takes three exported datasets from LinkedIn: connections, invitations, and messages. Once loaded into the system, the backend logic prepares this data using structured transformation scripts, setting the stage for meaningful visualization.

The application is built with Dash by Plotly â€” ensuring a seamless experience in navigating between visual elements. Every section is modular, meaning each piece of data visualization can evolve independently.

The header greets you with a personalized view, and the layout allows for selecting the period of analysis. This interactivity adds flexibility to how insights are revealed, allowing you to compare different time windows or track changes over specific career periods.

## ðŸ§  Analytical Storytelling

The dashboard isnâ€™t just about pretty charts â€” itâ€™s about surfacing trends that arenâ€™t obvious at a glance. 

Through visual storytelling, several perspectives emerge:
- A growth timeline showing how your network expanded over time.
- Common employers among your connections reveal where influence is strongest.
- Job titles highlight dominant themes and roles across your network.
- Word clouds and donut charts capture the diversity (or lack thereof) in your industry presence.

Each visualization is driven by tailored logic designed to filter noise and amplify signal.

## ðŸ§± Project Structure & Thought Process

This isnâ€™t a monolithic app. Itâ€™s built with maintainability and scalability in mind:

- `app.py` boots the dashboard and connects the components.
- `graphics/` houses the plotting logic.
- `pages/dashboard/view/` orchestrates the different visual blocks â€” header, overview, and deep dives.
- `utils/data_preperation.py` takes care of data wrangling so the visualizations are clean and context-aware.
- `assets/` handles aesthetics: fonts, CSS, logos, and branding elements.
- `environment/` keeps settings and variables organized.

Screenshots are included to visually represent the dashboard's purpose and outcomes.
